Well the other factor was my spare bishop of course, but I did not get to use it as much as I liked, until the very last moments of the game. The other thought: even without truly understanding the London, I find it easier to play it in average and survive against most setups, even ones that trade the dark squared bishop, or KID or the Anti London c5.

e4,,"I felt I should annotate this game for reasons that I hope will become clear. This game was a part of the 199th GK tournament. Round 1 of the tournament began when my rating was very much in the ascendancy, so much so that by the end of round 1 I was moved up to the next level! While I understand why this happens, in my case it felt rather unfair moving from the upper realms of the group to the lower ones of the next group, this wasn't helped as my rating began its inevitable and eventually long slide in the wrong direction. This game was against the highest ranked opponent of the group who was rated over 1900. My rating peak was in the lower 1700's and I was just about comfortable there. Playing someone rated this highly felt optimistic to say the least, particularly as my rating had dipped below 1600 for the first time in a while and was still descending. Needless to say I lost 5 of the 6 games and there was only this one left where I had any chance whatsoever of regaining some of my lost pride. The game begins with my usual opening as white.
