Despite that, this will obviously just contain my low-rated thoughts and a little machine analysis. I'll annotate some tactics I saw and some tactics the machine saw. If anyone ever reads this, this is my first time doing this so I'm sorry if I do it wrong, and I hope you enjoy. I won't be able to provide much theory because I myself don't know much yet.

It seems to like bishops on e6 & d6 presumably to go both ways depending which side White castles. Nf3 accelerates black castling + Re8+ as it takes away the options of those games where white plays Ne2 and then has the choice of castling king side or queenside (I say that becase people always say white can castle queenside and have the momentum on K-side attack with a pawn charge but I don't really remember seeing that too many times) and of course a real benefit of Ne2 is Ng3 Nf5 if white has the K-side attacking momentum",21,-14,-35.0,f8d6

Nick didn't really like h6 as it may become a target but white has the threat of Qc2 and black runs out of tempi (can't play Qc7!!!) so Nick concluded that the better options are h6 or perhaps Be7, preventing d5 and not allowing a rook exchange c5 looks flashy but d5 is what gets white some really crushing lines - - if white gets b3,c4, d5 pawns and also gets Bb2, f4, Nf5 and active rooks then the minute the white queen gets to join the k-side attack, black is really struggling - h6 can be so useful for black because if you don't play that then if white gets his knight into play black faces all sorts of threats involving Bd3, Qh5, Ng5 or Nf5 (if it comes via e2 & g3), Bb2 - one trick that recurs for white is d5 cxd5 cxd5 Bx d5 Qh5 threatening Qxh7 and winning the bishop",-30,53,83.0,"c1d2, b8d7, f3h4"

The point is that after castling, the f pawn doesn't win the bishop because the e pawn is no longer pinned. After that, and exchanging queens on d4 my king is quite safe and black's king ends up very exposed. It'd go: 7. Bg5 f6 8. O-O-O Qb4 9. Rhe1 Qxd4 10. Nxd4 Kf7 to avoid a discovered check I believe. SF on the other hand recommends castling first. So at first glance, this probably seems like a very easy decision, but I spent some time on this. I wanted two things in this position and I wasn't sure which to do first: either to develop the dark squared bishop and bring the a rook into the game, or to get the king to safety and unpin the pawn.

Even though white has a castled king he is still a minimum of 3 moves from full development and that is if I do not count central placement of the rooks. I am opposed to early a or h pawn moves (when white) to the 3rd rank. This gives your opponent a hook to pry the enemy king out of hiding. There does come a point when the a3 or h3 pawn moves are needed. For instance, a castled king has a rook protecting the 1st rank, but the rook is needed else where. You open the h3 pawn in case there is a back rank check. However, early in the game I feel it is more important to develop minor pieces and gain central control. You will see this move done often when a knight is perched on g5 or b5. The knight when placed there typically do not pose an immediate threat because they need another minor piece or a pawn to truly gain a hold in your territory. There is time to deal with the threat. I find that many players will use the a or h pawn to kick the knight. They do this almost by rote like an enemy in your camp must be pushed away no matter what.",21,-14,-35.0,"h8g8, f3d2, b8c6"

In the late 1970s, however, Karpov, Kasparov and others found different methods to play the Exchange Variation with White, often involving an early Rb1 to remove the rook from the sensitive a1–h8 diagonal, as well as attempting to hinder the development of Black's queenside. Another, relatively recently developed system involves quickly playing Be3, Qd2, and Rc1 or Rd1 to fortify White's centre, remove White's rook from the diagonal, and possibly enable an early d5 push by White.

In general it is not recommended to exchange a bishop for a knight. However, a temporary tactical advantage can be gained in the early stages of the game when the board is crowded and the knight's ability to jump over pieces can be helpful. Bishops on the other hand, become more powerful as the game wears on and the pieces get cleared off the board. In this position it is not clear that white's knights will be immediately useful and black decides to go with the long term advantage of the bishop pair. And so black gains the initiative. However, if white had retreated with his bishop to b3 white wins the d4 pawn and if black is not careful he loses his bishop too. E.g. 6. Bb3 exd4. If white insists on taking back the pawn: 7. Nxd4? Nxd4 8. Qxd4 c5! 9. Qd5 threatening mate on f7 and the rook on a8. 9... Be6 defending against both threats. 10. Qc6+ Bd7 11.
